<section style="text-align: center;">
<p>An idle walk to the corner store,</p>
<p1>In search of something to smoothen out the edge of the day,</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p2>Or maybe open a a taxing lock on your want for more,</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3>To let free the air that will lead the way,</p3>
<br>
<br>
<p4>After the satisfaction of the pour,</p4>
<br>
<br>
<p5>Comes steps with a handful, to take your mind astray,</p5>
<br>
<br>
<p6>More than needed is the price of the tour,</p6>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p7>To keep the high looks, you head to the counter,</p7>
<br>
<br>
<p8>To exchange valuables with the clerk you encounter,</p8>
<br>
<br>
<p9>The sounds of the increasing wage causes a grin,</p9>
<br>
<br>
<p10>And a realization it wasn't as important as it seemed,</p10>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p11>The clerk grabs a bag made of one atom weight of a dozen,</p11>
<br>
<br>
<p12>And another one away from nothing,</p12>
<br>
<br>
<p13>For every one of the heavier is two of the other,</p13>
<br>
<br>
<p14>With the former having a double bond together,</p14>
<br>
<br>
<p15>Between itself, to make the chain come in order,</p15>
<br>
<br>
<p16>The polyethylene taking the form of a trigonal planar,</p16>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p17>The nonpolar molecule is trust down a tube for melting,</p17>
<br>
<br>
<p18>Made smooth on the other end with thin sharp edges so exalting,</p18>
<br>
<br>
<p19>Then it rolls on a belt getting cut into the desired shape,</p19>
<br>
<br>
<p20>And shipped to the destination in rolls of tape,</p20>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p21>The bag sizzles as the items rush for the bottom causing an impact,</p21>
<br>
<br>
<p22>The tension is eased by the elasticity to keep it intact,</p22>
<br>
<br>
<p23>As it changes hands it is welcomed with a firm grip,</p23>
<br>
<br>
<p24>And a smile to ensure Elation of what is theirs to keep,</p24>
<br>
<br>
<p25> Firm steps are taken radiating the pride of ownership,</p24>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p26>Not to fast, and not too slow, just enough to get to the door,</p26>
<br>
<br>
<p27>Completing another cycle of a weekly trip to the corner store.</p27>
